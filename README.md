# Mapping_Earthquakes
---
##### The purpose of this project was to create three different earthquake maps (streets, satellite streets, and dark) with earthquake and Tectonic plate overlays. We then added a major earthquake overlay with earthquakes that have a magnitude greater than 4.5.
##### We used d3.json to parse the earthquake and tectonic plate data as well as leaflet maps that we styled with lines to represent the tectonic plates and circle markers to represent earthquakes and their given radius. Pop-up markers were also added to identify each earthquake on the map.
